Package deep provides the DeepLeabra variant of Leabra, which performs predictive
learning by attempting to predict the activation states over the Pulvinar nucleus
of the thalamus (in posterior sensory cortex), which are driven phasically every
100 msec by deep layer 5 intrinsic bursting (5IB) neurons that have strong focal
(essentially 1-to-1) connections onto the Pulvinar Thalamic Relay Cell (TRC)
neurons.

This package has 3 specialized Layer types:

  - SuperLayer: implements the superficial layer neurons, which function just
    like standard leabra.Layer neurons, while also directly computing the
    Burst activation signal that reflects the deep layer 5IB bursting activation,
    via thresholding of the superficial layer activations
    (Bursting is thought to have a higher threshold).

  - CTLayer: implements the layer 6 regular spiking CT corticothalamic neurons
    that project into the thalamus.  They receive the Burst activation via a
    CTCtxtPath pathway type, typically once every 100 msec, and integrate
    that in the CtxtGe value, which is added to other excitatory conductance
    inputs to drive the overall activation (Act) of these neurons.
    Due to the bursting nature of the Burst inputs, this causes these CT layer
    neurons to reflect what the superficial layers encoded on the *previous*
    timestep -- thus they represent a temporally delayed context state.

    CTLayer can send Context via self pathways to reflect the extensive
    deep-to-deep lateral connectivity that provides more extensive temporal
    context information.

  - TRCLayer: implement the TRC (Pulvinar) neurons, upon which the prediction
    generated by CTLayer pathways is projected in the minus phase.  This is
    computed via standard Act-driven pathways that integrate into standard Ge
    excitatory input in TRC neurons.  The 5IB Burst-driven plus-phase "outcome"
    activation state is driven by direct access to the corresponding driver SuperLayer
    (not via standard pathway mechanisms).

Wiring diagram:

	 SuperLayer --Burst--> TRCLayer
	   |                      ^
	CTCtxt          /- Back -/
	  |            /
	  v           /
	CTLayer -----/  (typically only for higher->lower)

Timing:

The alpha-cycle quarter(s) when Burst is updated and broadcast is set in
BurstQtr (defaults to Q4, can also be e.g., Q2 and Q4 for beta frequency updating).
During this quarter(s), the Burst value is computed in SuperLayer, and this is
continuously accessed by TRCLayer neurons to drive plus-phase outcome states.

At the *end* of the burst quarter(s), in the QuarterFinal method,
CTCtxt pathways convey the Burst signal from Super to CTLayer neurons,
where it is integrated into the Ctxt value representing the temporally delayed
context information.
